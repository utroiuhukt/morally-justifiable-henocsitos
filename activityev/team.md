## DISCUSSION

--- 

Here are additional ethical principles that are relevant to Sam Bentâ€™s case:

1. The Principle of Justice
Justice implies that people should receive fair and proportional treatment for their actions. In this case, the question  
arises: Did Sam Bent truly receive a just punishment, or did his cooperation with law enforcement allow him to avoid a  
harsher sentence? Another debate is whether justice should focus more on rehabilitation rather than punishment.

3. The Principle of Integrity
This principle refers to acting with honesty and consistency with moral values. Bent went from selling illegal drugs to  
 working with law enforcement as a cybersecurity consultant. Did he truly become an ethical person, or did he simply find a
way to reduce his sentence?

5. The Principle of Security
Bent used advanced tools to protect his identity and operate on the Darknet. However, security should also be considered from 
 a societal perspective: how can public safety be ensured when networks exist that facilitate drug trafficking and other  
 illicit activities?

6. The Principle of Trust
Society depends on trust in institutions and law enforcement. When criminals like Bent cooperate with the justice system, it
can create distrust if they are perceived to receive preferential treatment or if their punishment is not proportional to  
 their crimes. 

8. The Principle of Proportionality
This principle states that punishment or consequences should be proportional to the harm caused. If Bent significantly  
 reduced his sentence by cooperating, it could be seen as a disproportionate benefit compared to the damage he caused through 
  drug sales.
