JUSTIFIABLE 
## What is the Darknet?
the darknet is a no resgistered part of the internet a "secret part of the web".
Most of the people use this to avoid law and do illegal things, such as selling drugs and other illegal activities.
Despite of what most people think about this site is too easy to access and is not full of psychopaths and also you can give it a great use for education
about ethical hacking and other things.

## Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?
it is not morally respectable cause the hacker is still doing a crime, anyways is better using sexual offenders to what he was doing than causing damage
to people who may be inocent and have no llegal problems 

## Does the fact that he has been working with the justice redeem the crimes he did?
not completely redeem but he is trying to do some good with the experience he got with the bad things he did, so its ok thah he went out of prison 
and is trying to make a good for the people.

## Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, did he violate any principle?
when he connect the "router" to his neighbour's house and watch from his house when black cars arrived so he would know when its time 
to delete the evidence. he violated his neighbour security and privacy putting him in danger against the law. 

## If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?
i would ask him about cybersecurity and how to protect yourself in the internet also i would ask him about his most scaring experience when using the
darkweb and he felt he was in real danger.
