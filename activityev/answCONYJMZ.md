## QUESTIONS  
========================
1. **What is the Darknet?**   
    The Darknet is a part of the internet that is not accessible through conventional search engines like Google. It relies
    on encrypted networks that require special software, such as Tor or I2P, to access. While it has legitimate uses, such 
    as protecting privacy and enabling free speech under authoritarian regimes, it is also used for illegal activities,
    including drug trafficking, the sale of stolen data,  and other crimes.
   

3. **Is it morally respectable to use individuals (even if they are criminals)?**  
    Using criminals as informants presents an ethical dilemma. On one hand, it can help law enforcement capture more 
    dangerous criminals and prevent future crimes. However, it can also send the message that crime can be "forgiven"
    if one later cooperates with justice. From an ethical standpoint, this could violate the principle of justice, as
    the consequences for past crimes might not be proportional.
   
    
5. **Does the fact that he has been working with the justice redeem the crimes he did?**
    Working with the justice system can be seen as an act of responsibility and a way of making amends, but it does not
    necessarily redeem his crimes. While his knowledge can be valuable in preventing further Darknet crimes, his past
    actions caused harm, and their impact on the victims remains. True redemption would require not only cooperating with
    justice but also compensating those affected by his actions.
   
    
7. **Pick one of the measures that he took to protect himself, did he violate any principle?**
    Sam Bent used the principle of privacy to avoid being tracked, employing tools such as encryption and cryptocurrency 
    transactions. However, this conflicted with the principles of justice and responsibility, as he used these measures tO
    facilitate drug sales and evade legal consequences. While privacy is a right, using it to commit crimes represents an
    ethical violation.{  
    
9. **If you had the opportunity to ask Sam Bent about his experience, what would you ask him?**
    *"Do you think there is a way for the Darknet to be used ethically and legally without it becoming a space for crime?"*  
    This question aims to explore his perspective on whether the Darknet has the potential to be used positively or if its 
    structure inevitably enables illegal activities.
